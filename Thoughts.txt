Check file structure is correct

Reduce file size of background image?
Make Axis of graphs not effected by opacity!


Label Graphs
Clubs sold graph line (green)
Clubs bought graph line (Red)
Colour graphs (Can I colour per team selected?)


Get graphs started!

Start with Summer/Winter transfers, switching between premier/championship

Summer/Winter two scatter graphs (start with one if needs be)
Then total transfers for prem/championship in a pie chart (enabling selection of prem/champ in scatter chart)

Use scatter so that can do the circle thing!
