@canny I may be wrong, but I think you can't make the charts responsive as in for them to resize when you want them to. But you can make the containers they are in move around when a certain size screen size comes into play, in the same way you learnt in stream 1.

In my app https://fierce-crag-29219.herokuapp.com/graphs if you view on a mobile device I created a pop up that says it's best viewed in landscape.

Or you could create two graphs of the same type with different dimensions and have one set to display: none but when it comes to a certain screen size change it to display: block (or what ever you like) and then the other one to display: none this should hide the 'larger' one for desktops and bring the 'mobile' one into play.

@canny You can make the dashboard responsive using the methods @jamessan85 describes. However the svg image will only shrink to a certain size before being cropped. I like the idea of having a smaller chart appear by media query on a small screen size.

----------------------

You can make your charts responsive in javascript by giving your charts width a variable that you update when you initially create the charts and again whenever the browser window is resized.
My project is still being worked on but you can see this working https://pokemon-stream2-project.herokuapp.com/charts
